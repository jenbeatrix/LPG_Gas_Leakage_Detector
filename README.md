# LPG Leakage Detection with Alarm,SMS Alert & Automatic Valve Shutdown
The purpose of this project is to detect the presence of LPG leakage. Apart from the sound alarm, a Short Message Service (SMS) alert will be sent to inform the authorized person if any gas leakage occurs and the solenoid valve will trigger to shut down the gas supply to prevent any more harmful effects due to gas leakage. 

Note: This is just a prototype.

When the Gas Sensor senses the gas from the lighter (A gas leakage for instance but only demonstrated in a way that is not dangerous), the solenoid valve automatically closes or shuts down and a continuous alarm will trigger. The alarm won't stop until the owner prsesses the reset button.

Also, the user or owner of the house receives a text indicating that an LPG Leakage has occured.
