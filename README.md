# LPG_Leakage_Detector
The purpose of this project is to detect the presence of LPG leakage. Apart from the sound alarm, a Short Message Service (SMS) alert will be sent to inform the authorized person if any gas leakage occurs and the solenoid valve will trigger to shut down the gas supply to prevent any more harmful effects due to gas leakage. 

Note: This is just a prototype.
